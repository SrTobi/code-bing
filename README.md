## How it works

Press `ctrl+alt+f` or use the `Bing` command to search the selected text.
You can also enter the text, that you want to search.

Specify the search engine you want to use with fully customizable shortcuts in the search box.

## Set your favorite search engine

You can change the search engine in your settings by setting the `codebing.defaultProvider` option to one of your search engine shortcuts or to a new query string.

```
	"codebing.defaultProvider": "b"
```


## Install CodeBing

Use VS Code's extension installer by pressing __F1__ and searching for `Extensions: Install Extensions`.
In the next input box enter `code-bing` and wait for the installer to find CodeBing. Hit Enter to install.

## Other setting

You can define the list of search providers and their shortcuts in the `codebing.searchProviders` option.
__Note__ that setting this option will remove all default search providers.

```
 "codebing.searchProviders": {
	"b": "https://www.bing.com/search?q={query}",
	"g": "https://www.google.com/search?q={query}",
	"yh": "https://search.yahoo.com/search?p={query}",
	"ddg": "https://duckduckgo.com/?q={query}",
	"wiki": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{query}",
	"yt": "https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query={query}",
	"twit": "https://twitter.com/search?q={query}",
	"gh": "https://github.com/search?utf8=âœ“&q={query}"
}
```

If you do not want to use shortcuts, set `codebing.useDefaultProviderOnly` to `true`:

```
"codebing.useDefaultProviderOnly": true
```

Set `codebing.noInputBoxIfTextSelected` to `true` to skip the inputbox if you have selected text:

```
"codebing.noInputBoxIfTextSelected": true
```
